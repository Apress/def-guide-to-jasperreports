The Definitive Guide to JasperReports - Source Code
=====================================================

This package contains all the samples mentioned in the book.
If the same sample is referenced in two different chapters, each of the chapter folders will contain a copy of the sample.

These samples are taken from the public JasperReports source code distribution package, where they can be found under the /demo/samples folder.

We recommend that you test the samples from the project distribution package, which can be downloaded from here:
